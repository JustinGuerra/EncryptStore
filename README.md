# EncryptStore 
[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/EncryptStore/Encrypt%20Store/_apis/build/status/EncryptStore.CI?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/EncryptStore/Encrypt%20Store/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

This is a secure way to store things such as passwords, and logins for applications and websites.

## How to build/run
You will need to install the following software onto your machine.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

Once those are installed you will then run ```yarn install``` in the root of the cloned repository. Once this is done you can type ```yarn start``` and run the project. The reload and developer tools can be found under the "view" tab for now (or by their short cuts).
