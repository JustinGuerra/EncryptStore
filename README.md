# Encrypt Store

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/EncryptStore/Encrypt%20Store/_apis/build/status/EncryptStore.CI?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/EncryptStore/Encrypt%20Store/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

This is a secure way to store things such as passwords, and logins for applications and websites. Built with [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/)!

## How to build/run

You will need to install the following software onto your machine.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

Once those are installed you will then run ```yarn``` in the \app directory of the cloned repository. Once this is done you can type ```yarn start``` and run the project. The reload and developer tools can be found under the "view" tab for now (or by their short cuts).

## Contributing

For contributing to the project we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow, and before you contribute to this project be sure to discuss the changes you wish to make via an issue.

1. __Fork__ the repo on GitHub
2. __Clone__ the project to your own machine
3. __Commit__ changes to your own branch
4. __Push__ your work back up to your fork
5. Submit a __Pull request__ so that we can review your changes

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest "upstream" before making a pull request. Also make sure to follow our code of conduct for all interaction in the project.

### Pull Request Process

1. You must have 1-2 reviewers to sign off on your work
2. All build checks must pass
3. All test checks must pass (coming soon to a repo near you)

The suggested practice is to also make a pull request when you have started work and mark any issue that it references in the PR comments to let others know you are working on it. If your pull request is not ready you should mark it with __WIP__ in the title or via a label so that reviewers will know not to approve it.
